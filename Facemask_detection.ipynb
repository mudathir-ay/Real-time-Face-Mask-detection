        "Title: Real-time Face Mask Detection using Pre-trained ResNet Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Description:\n",
        "The project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using computer vision techniques and a pre-trained ResNet model. The system captures video frames from a webcam, applies face detection to locate faces in the frames, and then utilizes a deep learning model to classify each detected face as either wearing a mask or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project consists of two main parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Training the Face Mask Detection Model:\n",
        "   - The project starts with training a face mask detection model using a pre-trained ResNet model.\n",
        "   - A dataset of 100 images is used for training the model, where each image is labeled as either having a person wearing a mask or not.\n",
        "   - The pre-trained ResNet model, specifically ResNet-50, is employed as a feature extractor, and the final fully connected layer is modified to have two output neurons representing mask and no-mask classes.\n",
        "   - The model is trained using the dataset, and the training process involves optimizing the model's parameters using an Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.\n",
        "   - After training, the model is saved to a file for later use during real-time face mask detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Real-time Face Mask Detection:\n",
        "   - Once the model is trained and saved, the project focuses on real-time face mask detection using OpenCV.\n",
        "   - The system captures video frames from the webcam and applies face detection using the Haar cascade classifier provided by OpenCV.\n",
        "   - For each detected face, the model is utilized to classify whether the person is wearing a mask or not by passing the face through the trained model.\n",
        "   - The result is then displayed on the screen by drawing a rectangle around the face and adding a label indicating whether the person is wearing a mask or not.\n",
        "   - The process continues in real-time, detecting faces and updating the display accordingly.\n",
        "   - The system allows the user to exit the application by pressing the 'q' key.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project combines deep learning techniques with computer vision to address the important task of face mask detection. It can be applied in various settings, such as public spaces, workplaces, and healthcare facilities, to help ensure adherence to face mask policies and promote public health and safety."
